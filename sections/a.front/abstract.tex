The field of ontology engineering plays a crucial role in knowledge representation and has gained significant attention in recent years in many domains such as medicine, finance, and education. The introduction of the W3C recommended Web Ontology Language has further enabled use cases for ontology engineering in the context of the semantic web. With the growing size and complexity of these ontologies, however, ontologies become more susceptible to bugs, and it becomes harder to debug these defects. While debugging in software engineering has received much attention, tooling support for debugging ontologies remains limited. Moreover, in the context of the semantic web, automatic approaches to debugging ontologies are required for the combination of knowledge derived from independent sources. Axiom weakening has been proposed as a solution for fine-grained repair to inconsistent ontologies. This thesis presents an extension to the axiom weakening operator, in the $\SROIQ$ description logic, to cover a wider range of axiom types, including role inclusion axioms and role assertions. I show that the presented weakening operator retains desirable properties satisfied by previous approaches. The presented automated repair approach is experimentally evaluated against other repair approaches on a number of inconsistent ontologies. The thesis compares the amount of information that the repair is able to retain relative to other repairs based on the inferred concept hierarchy. Finally, the implementation of the presented axiom weakening operator in the popular ontology editor, Protégé, is discussed.
