The refinement and axiom weakening operators have previously been implemented for \ALC in \cite{troquard2018repairing}. Based on this, the implementation has been extended to cover the full range of \SROIQ axioms and concepts.\footnote{The source code is available at \url{https://github.com/rolandbernard/ontologyutils}.} The concept refinement and axiom weakening operators for \SROIQ have been implemented as discussed above. Further, repair algorithms using the axiom weakening operator based on the procedures already proposed in \cite{troquard2018repairing} and \cite{confalonieri2020towards} have been implemented. The implementation performs weakening in OWL 2 DL \cite{motik2012ontology} and is implemented in Java using the OWL API \cite{horridge2011owl,owlapi,matentzoglu2016introduction}. A plug-in for the ontology development tool Protégé has also been implemented and will be discussed in more detail.\footnote{The Protégé plugin is available at \url{https://github.com/rolandbernard/protege-weakening}.} The plug-in allows for manually weakening axioms and executing the automatic repair algorithm.
