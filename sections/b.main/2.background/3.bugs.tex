As software systems evolve, it becomes harder to avoid the emergence of bugs. Similarly, in ontology engineering, bugs can be introduced into an ontology. With the increasing size and complexity of a system, it also becomes more challenging to debug these defects, both for software systems and ontologies.

\subsection{Categories of Bugs} \label{categories-of-bugs}

Defects, in both software systems and ontologies, can be due to several different reasons. In \cite{kalyanpur2005debugging}, the authors identify three broad categories of defects that can be present in an ontology: \emph{syntactic defects}, \emph{semantic defects,} and \emph{modelling defects}.

\subsubsection{Syntactic Defects} \label{syntactic-defects}

Syntactic defects in an ontology can be caused by a statement that does not conform to the grammar of the employed logic. These sorts of defects are easy to locate and correct. In general, tool support for these kinds of defects is able to pinpoint the location of the defect and give an explanation to the user.

\begin{example}
  The axioms $C \sqsubseteq \sqsubseteq D$, $C(r(a, b))$, or $C \sqsubset D$ are all obviously not syntactically correct \SROIQ axioms. Similarly, the concepts $C \sqcup \sqcap D$, $\less 3 t.\self$, and $\self \sqcup D$ do not match the grammar for concept expressions.
\end{example}

There may, however, be some additional restrictions on what constitutes a valid ontology that are not based solely on the grammatical rules. For ontologies, these might be, for example, the restrictions placed upon the RDF graph for a specific OWL profile. In the case of \SROIQ, these include the restricted use of non-simple roles and the regularity condition placed on the RBox. Restrictions of this kind can often be much easier to violate and harder to debug than the syntactic defects which are simple violations of the grammar.

\begin{example}
  Given the vocabulary $N_C = \{ C \}$ and $N_R = \{ a, b, c \}$, the \SROIQ ontology $\Omc = \{ a \sqsubseteq b, b \circ c \sqsubseteq a \}$ is not valid. This is because it does not satisfy the regularity condition in \SROIQ. This can easily be verified by showing that no preorder $\preceq$ exists for which $a \preceq b$ and $a \not\preceq b$ hold.

  Similarly, the ontology $\Omc = \{ a \circ a \sqsubseteq a, \top \sqsubseteq \exists a.\self \}$ is invalid because the role $a$ is non-simple. Since roles used in \self constraints must be simple, the second axiom is not allowed.
\end{example}

\subsubsection{Semantic Defects} \label{semantic-defects}

For ontologies, semantic defects, as defined in \cite{kalyanpur2005debugging}, are those which can be discovered by a reasoner given an ontology free of syntactic defects. This includes, for example, the inconsistency of the ontology or the unsatisfiability of a concept. The presence of such defects is generally not hard to identify, given the availability of a reasoner for the logic of the ontology. It is, however, often not trivial to understand the underlying source of the defect. In this thesis, the focus will be mainly on these kinds of bugs, especially on the problem of inconsistent ontologies.

\begin{example}
  Given the vocabulary $N_C = \{ C, D \}$ and $N_I = \{ a \}$, the \SROIQ ontology $\Omc = \{ D \sqsubseteq \lnot C, D(a), C(a) \}$ is inconsistent. This can be seen clearly from the fact that for every interpretation $I$, $a^I$ must be in $D^I$, but this means that $a^I$ must not be in $C^I$, which contradicts the last axiom.
\end{example}

\subsubsection{Modelling Defects} \label{modelling-defects}

Modelling defects are all those defects that are not syntactic or semantic defects. The presence of unintended or absence of intended inferences is one such defect. These defects can also be of a more stylistic nature. Redundancy or unused parts of the ontology may be considered defects, since they do not add any knowledge to the ontology.

These kinds of defects can in general not be detected automatically by tools. They require careful attention and domain-specific knowledge to be revealed and corrected. In some scenarios, testing may be used to uncover and prevent some modelling defects by expressing more explicitly the intention of the modeller.

\subsection{Causes of Bugs} \label{causes-of-bugs}

We will now briefly explore the possible causes of bugs in the context of ontology engineering. One major source of defects is of course human error by the ontology developer. These can range from trivial typos, that will most often merely result in syntactic errors, to more fundamental misunderstandings of the domain, which can lead to modelling mistakes. Especially syntactic errors concerning the additional constraints, like regularity and simplicity, can easily be violated due to an oversight by the modeller. One can, for example, define a role as transitive and later use it in cardinality constraints. Unfortunately, however, this is not allowed in many ontology languages, such as in \SROIQ or OWL 2 DL. Similarly, mistakes during the modelling process can cause inconsistent ontologies or unsatisfiable concepts. The modeller might have defined two classes as disjoint, but later added an individual belonging to the intersection of the two concepts, yielding an inconsistent ontology.

Another common source for bugs in ontology engineering arises when merging different ontologies. This may be done, especially in the context of OWL and the semantic web, to combine the knowledge obtained from different sources. This can again be a case where one ontology defines a certain role as transitive, while the other one assumes that it is simple. Combining the two ontologies will then obviously lead to a violation of the global constraints. Also, different ontologies might make different but incompatible modelling choices when modelling the same domain. This can result in an ontology after merging that is inconsistent or has unsatisfiable concepts.

\begin{example}
  Given the vocabulary $N_C = \{ C, D \}$ and $N_I = \{ a, b \}$, the two \SROIQ ontology $\Omc_1 = \{ D \sqsubseteq C, D(a) \}$ and $\Omc_2 = \{ C \sqsubseteq \lnot D, C(b) \}$ are by themselves consistent. If we merge them, however, the resulting ontology $\Omc_1 \cup \Omc_2$ is no longer consistent.
\end{example}
