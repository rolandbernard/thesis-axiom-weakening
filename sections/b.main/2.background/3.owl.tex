Description logics are also the basis of the \emph{Web Ontology Language} (OWL) \cite{hitzler2009owl_primer,motik2009owl_spec}, which is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation and is extensively used as part of the semantic web. While the OWL 2 DL language is based on $\mathcal{SROIQ}$, OWL 2 also defines three so-called profiles that are fragments of the full OWL 2 language that trade-off expressive power for more efficient reasoning \cite{motik2009owl_profiles,motik2009owl_spec}. The OWL 2 DL profile, which is the most expressive of the profiles that is still decidable\footnote{The most expressive profile, OWL 2 Full, is not decidable.}, is based on $\mathcal{SROIQ}$.
