\begin{example}
Take as an example the ontology $\Omc = \{a \circ b \circ a \sqsubseteq c\}$ that defines the simple roles $a$ and $b$, and a non-simple role $c$. Adding the axiom $c \sqsubseteq b$, even if it is correct in isolation, will result in an ontology that is not regular.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
As another example, take the ontology $\Omc = \{a \circ a \sqsubseteq a, \top \sqsubseteq \exists c . \self \}$ that defines the transitive role $a$ and simple role $c$ used in a self-assertion. Adding the axiom $a \sqsubseteq c$, even if it may be correct in isolation, will result in a violation of the restrictions because $c$ will become non-simple and non-simple roles may not be used in self-assertions.
\end{example}
