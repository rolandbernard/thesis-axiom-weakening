# Axiom weakening in $\mathcal{ALC}$

The approach presented in this thesis is based on the algorithm discussed in (sroiq weakening).

The basic idea behind this method is to define two Refinement operators, a generalization operator and a specialization operator.

these functions return, for a concept or role in the input, a set of concepts or roles that are more general or more specific.

Example: (example for sroiq refinements)

the refinement operators can then be used for generating weaker (or stronger axioms). Using this mechanism for generating repairs is done by repeatedly replacing axioms in the ontology by weaker versions of themselves. 

Example: (example of weakening subsumptions)
