# The $\mathcal{SROIQ}$ Description Logic

Formally, an ontology is a set of statements expressed in a suitable logical language and with the purpose of describing a specific domain of interest. While ontologies can be represented using a number of different formalisms, for the use in automated reasoning a trade-off must be made between expressivity and practicality. For example, first-order logic (FOL) is more expressive than propositional logic, but this added expressivity comes at the cost of decidability. In addition to decidability, scalability must also be considered in the choice and design of the used representation of the knowledge.

*Description logics* (DL) are often used for building ontologies. They encompass a family of related knowledge representation languages and are often fragments of FOL with equality, as is the case with the description logics $\mathcal{SROIQ}$ which is the main focus of this work. DLs are almost always designed to be decidable, and generally offer a favourable trade-off between expressivity and complexity of reasoning tasks. Different description logics have been developed for different applications, that feature varying levels of expressivity.

The following section will introduce the description logic $\mathcal{SROIQ}$. The description is based on the one presented in [Foundations of Description Logics]().
