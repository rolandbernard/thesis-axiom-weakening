# The Web Ontology Language

Description logics are also the basis of the *Web Ontology Language* (OWL) [OWL 2 Spec](), which is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation and is extensively used as part of the semantic web. While the OWL 2 DL language is based on $\mathcal{SROIQ}$, OWL 2 also defines three  other so-called profiles that are fragments of the full OWL 2 language that trade-off expressive power for more efficient reasoning [OWL 2 Web Ontology Language Profiles](). The OWL 2 DL profile is the most expressive of these profiles that is still decidable.

In addition to the different profiles, differnt syntax exist for OWL 2

The syntax used by the structural specification is the so-called functional-syntax.

Other common representations include:

The XML/RDF format, which is mainly used for exchanging ontologies between tools and not as a format in which to author an ontology.

The Manchester syntax.

The Turtle syntax.

highly optimized reasons for owl 2 exist. some reasoners support only some of the more restrictive profiles, while others support OWL 2 DL.

in this thesis owl 2 dl reasoners are used for evaluation of the proposed approach to axiom weakening in SROIQ and the owl api is used to interface with them
