# Axiom Weakening

We build upon the axiom weakening approaches presented in (ALC weakening) and (SROIQ weakening)

We slightly modify the definitions to make them match closer the implementation used for the evaluation

The main changes that were made are that the covers now have as parameters not only a reference ontology, but also the concepts and roles from which they select subsets.

## Upward and Downward Covers

intuitively the upward and downward covers select from the set of allowed concepts or roles those which are the least .

## Refinement Operators

## Axiom Weakening

## Repair using Axiom Weakening
