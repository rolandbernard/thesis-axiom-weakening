Structuring a bachelor thesis can be challenging but it’s also an opportunity to showcase your research skills. [Here’s a typical structure of a bachelor thesis that you can use as a starting point](https://www.mos.ed.tum.de/en/tb/lehre/theses/structure/):

1. Introduction
    - Provide an entryway to your topic
2. Literature Review
    - Show that you are capable of working scientifically
3. Data Collection
    - Describe in detail which data you use and how you collect these data
4. Analysis
5. Conclusions
