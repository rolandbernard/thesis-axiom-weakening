1. Introduction
1.1 Background
- Importance of ontology engineering in knowledge representation in various domains
- Role of Web Ontology Language (OWL) in ontology engineering for the semantic web
- Challenges in debugging ontologies due to their increasing size and complexity
1.2 Problem Statement
- Limited tooling support for debugging ontologies
- Need for automatic approaches for debugging in the context of the semantic web
1.3 Objectives
- Extension of axiom weakening operator in the SROIQ description logic to cover a wider range of axiom types
