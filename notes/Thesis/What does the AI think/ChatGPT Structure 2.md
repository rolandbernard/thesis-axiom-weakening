7. Literature Review: A chapter that critically examines the existing literature on the research topic, highlighting gaps in knowledge, and suggesting how the research will fill those gaps.
8. Methodology: A chapter that outlines the methods and techniques used to conduct the research, including the research design, data collection methods, and data analysis techniques.
9. Results: A chapter that presents the findings of the research, typically including graphs, tables, and other visual aids.
10. Discussion: A chapter that interprets the results, discusses their implications, and relates them to the research questions.
11. Conclusion: A summary of the key findings and their implications, as well as suggestions for future research.
12. References: A list of all the sources cited in the thesis, formatted according to a specific citation style (e.g., APA, MLA).
