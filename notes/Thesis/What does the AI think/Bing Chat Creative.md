- Introduction: Explain the motivation and goals of the thesis, provide some background on description logics and axiom weakening, and state the main research questions and contributions.
- Related Work: Review the existing literature on axiom weakening and related techniques for repairing inconsistent ontologies, such as deletion, completion, and abduction. Compare and contrast the different approaches and identify the gaps or challenges that your thesis aims to address.
- Methodology: Describe the formal framework and definitions for axiom weakening, such as the syntax and semantics of description logics, the notion of refinement operators, and the criteria for selecting optimal or minimal weakenings. Explain how you implement and evaluate your method using existing tools or datasets.
- Results and Discussion: Present and analyze the results of your experiments or case studies using axiom weakening. Highlight the main findings and implications of your method, such as its advantages, limitations, scalability, and applicability. Discuss how your results answer your research questions and contribute to the state of the art.
- Conclusion and Future Work: Summarize the main contributions and outcomes of your thesis, reflect on the limitations and challenges of your method, and suggest some directions for future research or improvement.
