- [x]  Axiom weakening should return sets of axioms that together are weaker?
    - [x]  e.g. useful for Disjoint Classes (split arguments into two disjoint sets)
    - [x]  e.g. the same also for the equivalent classes axiom
- [x]  Extend the axiom refinement to handle non-normalized axioms
- [x]  Add ALC strict mode
- [x]  Add SROIQ strict mode
