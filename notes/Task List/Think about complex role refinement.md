- [x]  Does the current approach work well for $\mathcal{ALCOIQH}$?
    
    Yes, since all roles inclusions are simple and all roles are simple, all weakening are allowed.
    
- [x]  Which other kinds of transformations are safe?
    
    Compute a regular pre-order and use it to restrict the allowed weakening?
